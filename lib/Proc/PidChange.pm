=head1 NAME

Proc::PidChange - execute callbacks when PID changes

=head1 VERSION

version 0.001

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    use Proc::PidChange;

    ## check for pid changes
    check_current_pid();

    ## Registration of callbacks
    use Proc::PidChange ':all';

    register_pid_change_callback(sub { ... });

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This module provides a simple API to check if the process ID changed,
due to a fork() call. If such change is detected, it calls all the
registered callbacks.

The detection of PID changes can be done in two ways: in real-time as
soon as it changes, or by calling L</check_current_pid> on a regular
basis. The real-time version requires the L<POSIX::AtFork> module.

Interested parties should use the L</register_pid_change_callback> to
register a CodeRef to be called when the PID change is detected.

=head2 About real-time PID changes

Given that real-time is the most efficient method to detect PID changes,
we aggresively try to load L<POSIX::AtFork> module and if found, enable
real-time PID detection.

You can check to see if real-time detection is being used with the
C<$Proc::PidChange::RT> variable. If true, real-time detection is
available.

You can disable real-time detection by setting the
C<PROC_PIDCHANGE_NO_RT> environment to true before loading
L<Proc::PidChange>.

=head1 FUNCTIONS

=head2 check_current_pid

Check the current PID to see if it's changed. If yes, calls all
registered callbacks.

=head2 register_pid_change_callback

Register one or more callbacks to be called when the PID change
is detected.

If you register the same CodeRef callback twice, it will be
called twice.

=head2 unregister_pid_change_callback

Unregister one or more callbacks.
